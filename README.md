#Made by Sandeepak

‘To-Do’ application. The user should be able to add, edit or delete their entries in the to-do list. Feel free to use whatever technology/framework that you are comfortable with (any mix of frontend, backend, and database technologies/frameworks). You’d also need to implement user authentication and authorization functionalities. Include at least two RESTful APIs that perform basic CRUD operations on a specific resource (e.g., adding tasks). Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure) or provide instructions on how to run it locally. Document the technologies used, any important architectural decisions, and provide instructions on how to set up and test the application
